# Each compound

The four types of examples are available here.

Brief introduction for each compound is follows.
See "https://materialsproject.org/" and the DFT input files
to confirm the structure data.

Bi:
symmetry group: R-3m (#166) symmorphic
Without spin-orbit coupling, the high symmetry line semi metal.
With spin-orbit coupling, the higher-order topological insulator.
The symmetry-based indicator is calculated from irreps. of inversion symmetry.

Si:
symmetry group: Fd-3m (#227) non-symmorphic
Trivial semiconductor.
The symmetry-based indicator is calculated from irreps. of inversion symmetry.
